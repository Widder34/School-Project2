  <p>
    As of October 6, 2025, Bangladesh is facing a serious dengue outbreak. Over 50,000 people have been infected, and 215 have died, according to the Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS). This is much higher than earlier in the year, and experts say that climate change, unusual rain, and delays in mosquito control are making the problem worse.
  </p>

  <h2>Why Dengue is Spreading</h2>
  <p>
    Professor Kabirul Bashar, a mosquito expert at Jahangirnagar University, explains that longer monsoon rains and unexpected rainfall have created perfect conditions for Aedes mosquitoes, which spread dengue. Because of this, the virus is spreading faster and more widely than before.

  <h2>Hospitals Are Overcrowded</h2>
  <p>
    Many hospitals in cities like Dhaka are struggling. They are full of patients, especially children, with symptoms like high fever, rashes, and dehydration. Doctors and nurses are under a lot of pressure to care for everyone.
  </p>

  <h2>What Can Be Done</h2>
  <p>
    Experts say urgent action is needed. This includes:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Fogging to kill mosquitoes</li>
    <li>Removing standing water where mosquitoes breed</li>
    <li>Public awareness campaigns to encourage people to use mosquito nets and repellents</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>The Future</h2>
  <p>
    The monsoon season is not over yet, so more outbreaks are possible. Experts warn that without quick and strong action, the dengue situation in Bangladesh could get even worse. This shows how important it is to act quickly and protect communities from mosquito-borne diseases.
